 “Why are you interested in this role?”

I recently participated in KPMG's job simulation on the Forage platform, and it
was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate on the
Data, Analytics & Modelling team at KPMG.
I worked on a project to advise a client on customer targeting and I practiced
assessing data quality, garnering insights, and creating dashboards in a
real-world context.
Doing this program confirmed that I really enjoy working to leverage data to
produce better business outcomes and I'm excited to apply these skills on a
Data, Analytics & Modelling team at a company like KPMG.
